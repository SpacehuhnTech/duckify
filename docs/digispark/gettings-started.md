# Digispark

<img src="/img/Digispark.jpg" width="200" alt="Digispark development board" />

The Digispark is a very simplistic development board based on the ATTiny85.
It's popular due to the Arduino compatibility, built-in USB-A plug (so no dangling cables!), the afforable price, and the fact that it can act as a keyboard.
