# Digispark

<img src="/img/Digispark.jpg" width="200" alt="Digispark development board" />

The Digispark is a very simplistic development board based on the ATTiny85.
It's popular due to the Arduino compatibility, built-in USB-A plug (so no dangling cables!), the affordable price, and the fact that it can act as a keyboard.

# TinyDuck

TinyDuck is another small dev board. It's specifically made for being used as a BadUSB, and since it's based on the same chip, it's fully compatible with the Digispark and this converter.  
You can learn more about the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/Tinyduck).
